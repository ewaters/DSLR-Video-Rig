DSLR Video Rig
==============

Purpose
-------

This project aims to create a do it yourself (DIY) digital single lens reflector (DSLR) video rig that approach the functionality of more professional commercial products.

There are many different configurations of a video rig.  The focus at the moment is on a shoulder balanced rig with an offset weight, along with a follow focus system, balanced with one hand grip.  This is similar in form to the following commercial products:

 * (Zacuto's Fast Draw)[http://store.zacuto.com/Fast-Draw.html] (see also http://www.zacuto.com/dslr-kits)
 * (RedRock Micro's eyeSpy)[http://store.redrockmicro.com/Catalog/DSLRShoulderMountedRigs/eyeSpy-Deluxe-Bundle-DSLR-rig]

It is hoped that as the project progresses we will have a number of different components that you can make at home that are interchangeable and allow for many different configurations.

Usage
-----

The files released so far are in (OpenSCAD)[http://openscad.org/] format, which allows us to easily design 3D objects that can be printed on a (RepRap Printer)[http://reprap.org].

Assembly
--------

1. Buy the hardware needed (tubing for the rails, nuts, bolts, knobs, etc)
2. Print the rewrapped parts on a RepRap
3. Assemble as desired
